In Huffman coding two different data structures were utilized, the Binary Tree, and the Priority Queue. The Priority Queue is
the one that's first initialized, with the charachters being aranged in the order of their priorites (Frequency/count). Once 
this is done they are then converted into a tree. Once the tree is formed with the data nodes at the leaves, the different code
for letters is found. A left child is indicated by '0' and a right child by '1'.
