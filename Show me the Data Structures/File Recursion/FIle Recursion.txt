In file recursion, the task at hand is to find all files with particular suffix in a given directory, and this can easily be
achieved using recursion and stacks. Using recursion we can navigate through any single directory and check for the file,
whereas using the stack we can detect for directories within directories and then navigate through them, once the scan of the 
current directory is complete.
