The active directory code mainly uses recursion to go through all the gropus present within a group to find out whether a particular
user is present or not. The function return False if its not there and True if the user is present. The final code block takes the sum
of all these differnt inputs and returns the value, this sum is True if atleast one of the inputs was True and False otherwise. 
This above function is known as the Boolean OR.
