This code block creates a very simplistic model of a blockchain. It consists of three classes a Block class, a Node class and a 
linked list class. The block class contains different types of information including the time at which the block was created and 
the data along with the current and previous hash. The node is what primarily contitues the linked list, with it containing an entire
block as its data and it pointing to the next node in the linked list.
