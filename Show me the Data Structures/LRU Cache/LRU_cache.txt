The LRU cache was designed using a queue because of as the name suggests the cache is designed to rid of elements that is the 
'Least Recently Used'. Hence a queue which pops the oldest element is ideally chosen. The queue however has an extra function 
'REORDER' which is used when an element is accessed from the queue. The reoerder function sends the elements that was requested 
by the user to its head as it becomes the most recently used element. And since the cache has a maximum of 5 elements in it, the 
time complexity of the same can be considered to be O(1).
